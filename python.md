**Objective**: To explore the language and understand the code written using OpenCV.

**Introduction**: Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.

**Equipments/Software used**: pycharm, python IDLE.

**Procedure**: Followed some tutorials. [Reference](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsyeobzWxl7poL9JTVyndKe62ieoN-MZ3)

**Results**: Completed

**Future work**: To write scripts using OpenCV-python for the ROV.
